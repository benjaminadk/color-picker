A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/benjaminadk/pen/vmMvgZ.

I made this with three weeks total coding experience.  Hopefully, I can add more features as I learn more about javascript and color for that matter.  Color is way more complicated than I thought.  Just take a look at the formula that converts an rgba color value into hsl format.  That was potentially something I wanted to use here.  That way I could easliy offer a palette of colors with different lightness or saturation.  All I have right now is a simple re ordering of the r the g and the b.  I think my last tile might actually be the complementary color.  I took each value and subtracted it from 255.  Anyway, I am not totally sure what my Ben palette is.  But the colors would work together if you pick your base and one or two from the Ben Palette.

I included an embedded you tube video which is four ten minute screencasts.  Mostly, I am just playing around.  In all seriousness though, had I watched a video like mine three weeks ago I would have benifitted from it.  Please feel free to get ahold of me if you somehow end up reading this.  I'm interested in any feedback or advice about color or anything else.  Thanks.
